# EDRDG Scripts
This is a collection of client-side scripts for improving the usability of [edrdg.org](https://www.edrdg.org/).
These programs can be imported into and launched via a [userscript manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager)
such as [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey).

These are third-party scripts written by myself and not officially endorsed by or
affiliated with the Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group.

### N-gram Corpus Count Percentages
This script adds usage percentages to the tables on the "N-gram Corpus Count" pages. It also adds an
appropriate amount of whitespace to each cell so that the data will align nicely when copied and
pasted into JMdictDB reference notes. [[Install](https://github.com/stephenmk/edrdg-scripts/raw/main/corpus_count_percentages.user.js)]
